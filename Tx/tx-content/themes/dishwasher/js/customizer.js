M: Are you kids making ugly faces?
B: Maybe.
M: Well, you know.  If you keep making those faces, you'll freeze that way.
   You'll be stuck with a horrible face forever.

L: Do you think Mom was telling the truth?
B: Mom wouldn't lie.

% returns to tell them to knock it off.  When she leaves, Bart and Lisa
% try to imitate her scowl; their attempts pale next to Maggie's

B: I call this face, ``Dad''.

M: All right.  I told you, if you kept making those horrible faces,
   they'd freeze that way.  And now they have.
L: They have!?
B: Our faces are frozen?
M: Yes, they are.  Go look in the mirror and see for yourselves.(GOSS NET 1) Tape 1/3 Page 3
