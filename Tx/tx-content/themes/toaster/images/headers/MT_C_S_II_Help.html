Shoe making is the process of making Foot Wear. Originally, shoes were made one at a time by hand. Traditional handicraft shoemaking has now been largely superseded in volume of shoes produced by industrial mass production of footwear, but not necessarily in quality, attention to detail, or craftsmanship.

Shoemakers or cordwainers (cobblers being those who repair shoes) may produce a range of footwear items, including shoes, boots, sandals, clogs and moccasins. Such items are generally made of leather, wood, rubber, plastic, jute or other plant material, and often consist of multiple parts for better durability of the sole, stitched to a leather upper.Enzymes act by converting starting molecules (substrates) into different molecules (products). Almost all chemical reactions in a biological cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates sufficient for life. Since enzymes are selective for their substrates and speed up only a few reactions from among many possibilities, the set of enzymes made in a cell determines which metabolic pathways occur in that cell, tissue and organ. Organelles are also differentially enriched in sets of enzymes to compartmentalise function within the cell.

Like all catalysts, enzymes increase the rate of a reaction by lowering its activation energy (Ea‡). As a result, products are formed faster and reactions reach their equilibrium state more rapidly. Most enzyme reaction rates are millions of times faster than those of comparable un-catalyzed reactions and some are so fast that they are diffusion limited. As with all catalysts, enzymes are not consumed by the reactions they catalyze, nor do they alter the equilibrium of these reactions. However, enzymes do differ from most other catalysts in that they are highly specific for their substrates. Enzymes are known to catalyze about 4,000 biochemical reactions.[3] A few RNA molecules called ribozymes also catalyze reactions, with an important example being some parts of the ribosome.[4][5] Synthetic molecules called artificial enzymes also display enzyme-like catalysis.[6]

Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: decreased by inhibitors or increased by activators. Many drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. Activity is also affected by temperature, pressure, chemical environment (e.g., pH), and the concentration of substrate. Some enzymes are used commercially, for example, in the synthesis of antibiotics. In addition, some household products use enzymes to speed up biochemical reactions (e.g., enzymes in biological washing powders break down protein or fat stains on clothes; enzymes in meat tenderizers break down proteins into smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew). The study of enzymes is called enzymology.The various Zebra species exhibit differing social structures. Plains (Equus burchelli) and mountain zebras (Equus zebra spp.) form groups, called harems, composed of a single, protective male, several females and their young. Sometimes, plains zebra harems combine with others to produce enormous herds, containing thousands of animals. By contrast, male and female Grevy’s zebras (Equus grevyi) live apart until environmental conditions are favorable, and food and water are plentiful. Once the conditions are adequate, they come together to mate. Male Grevy’s zebras mark their territories by depositing urine and dung along the periphery and through vocalizations – a behavior called “braying.” While female Grevy’s zebras are polyandrous and may breed with many different males in succession, most other females are monogamous and bond with a specific male.
Adjustments to Aridity

Zebras are well adapted to their arid habitat; most can go as long as five days without water. However, while females are lactating, they need water more frequently -- as often as every other day. Bachelor males and lactating females preferentially seek out greener pastures with younger grass growth. During such times, zebras may use their hooves to dig for water; if they are successful, they will defend such resources. Male Grevy’s zebras may establish territories that lie along paths to water or other such resources; often, they will intercept and breed receptive females as they pass through.
Courtship, Receptivity and Mating

The female’s estrus cycle lasts about five days, during which, they are receptive to mating for about two or three days. When ready to mate, the female arches her back, raises her hindquarters and moves her tail to the side. As with all equids, facial expressions form an important part of intraspecies communication, and the females will flatten their ears and open their mouths when receptive. Males often bare their teeth during the mating process, which may serve to intimidate the female or other males. Male Grevy’s zebras often mate with females repeatedly -- as often as every hour -- to ensure successful fertilization.
Timing of Parturition

Although the various species exhibit small variations in reproductive timing, most females are pregnant for 12 to 13 months. Female zebras typically give birth to one offspring at a time. Most females keep their newborn young, termed a foal, sequestered for a few days while they get to know their mother’s scent, enabling them to recognize her. The young stay with their mother for approximately two to three years.


For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth -- to know the worst and to provide for it. I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided; and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years, to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House? Replicating nanorobots

MNT nanofacturing is popularly linked with the idea of swarms of coordinated nanoscale robots working together, a popularization of an early proposal by K. Eric Drexler in his 1986 discussions of MNT, but superseded in 1992. In this early proposal, sufficiently capable nanorobots would construct more nanorobots in an artificial environment containing special molecular building blocks.

Critics have doubted both the feasibility of self-replicating nanorobots and the feasibility of control if self-replicating nanorobots could be achieved: they cite the possibility of mutations removing any control and favoring reproduction of mutant pathogenic variations. Advocates address the first doubt by pointing out that the first macroscale autonomous machine replicator, made of Lego blocks, was built and operated experimentally in 2002.[8] While there are sensory advantages present at the macroscale compared to the limited sensorium available at the nanoscale, proposals for positionally controlled nanoscale mechanosynthetic fabrication systems employ dead reckoning of tooltips combined with reliable reaction sequence design to ensure reliable results, hence a limited sensorium is no handicap; similar considerations apply to the positional assembly of small nanoparts. Advocates address the second doubt by arguing that bacteria are (of necessity) evolved to evolve, while nanorobot mutation could be actively prevented by common error-correcting techniques. Similar ideas are advocated in the Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology,[9] and a map of the 137-dimensional replicator design space[10] recently published by Freitas and Merkle provides numerous proposed methods by which replicators could, in principle, be safely controlled by good design.

However, the concept of suppressing mutation raises the question: How can design evolution occur at the nanoscale without a process of random mutation and deterministic selection? Critics argue that MNT advocates have not provided a substitute for such a process of evolution in this nanoscale arena where conventional sensory-based selection processes are lacking. The limits of the sensorium available at the nanoscale could make it difficult or impossible to winnow successes from failures. Advocates argue that design evolution should occur deterministically and strictly under human control, using the conventional engineering paradigm of modeling, design, prototyping, testing, analysis, and redesign.

It is a reasonable conjecture that the general principles of settlement which they at first suggested originated with the more liberal statesmen of Germany and Austria, the men who have begun to feel the force of their own peoples' thought and purpose, while the concrete terms of actual settlement came from the military leaders who have no thought but to keep what they have got. The negotiations have been broken off. The Russian representatives were sincere and in earnest. They cannot entertain such proposals of conquest and domination. 

Bed rest is well known to have numerous adverse effects on the human body (see Table 1).1, 2 Functional decline, defined as loss of the ability to perform self-care or activities of daily living, may result not only from illness or adverse treatment effects, but also from deconditioning associated with inactivity, the negative effects of which can be seen after relatively short periods. For a variety of reasons, however, hospitalized patients spend most of their time in bed, even when they are able to walk. For example, a study of 45 elderly patients on a general medical unit, who had neither delirium nor dementia and were able to walk prior to admission, found that they spent an average of 20 out of every 24 hours in bed over the mean 5.1 days they were hospitalized.3 Similarly, researchers who studied 78 adults admitted to a respiratory unit for diagnostic or preoperative evaluation, who were able to walk and not confined to bed rest, found that over a five-day period their functional capacity had decreased in all six areas assessed: upper limb muscle strength, respiratory muscle strength, lung function, chest wall expansion, submaximal exercise tolerance, and spinal and trunk mobility, the latter of which was associated with a 30% rise in reports of back pain.4 Longer periods of hospitalization inevitably lead to more severe deconditioning. I. Identification

1. The Issue
Tobacco is well known for its negative effects on health. Yet, the environmental impact of tobacco production is not always recognized. There appears to be a direct link between tobacco production and deforestation. For countries that devote much of their land to the production of tobacco, this could pose a problem. Malawi is one such example. Tobacco is Malawi's largest industry and currently accounts for nearly 80% of the nation's export earnings. Strong government support for the tobacco industry, including subsidies and tax breaks, has led to tobacco's domination of Malawi's export market. The tobacco industry was intended to increase economic growth and promote development in Malawi. Unfortunately, things have not gone accordingly to plan. The price of tobacco on international markets continues to fall, with no sign of abating. Malawi remains economically stunted, the average live expectancy is gradually declining, and malnutrition, especially in children, continues to be a serious problem. Further, the environmental resources of this nation are at risk. Deforestation, in particular, is a major problem in Malawi. The threat of deforestation, some argue (Tobin, 1998), can be largely attributed to the tobacco industry. Malawi is now at a pivotal point where it must reevaluate its economic strategy and make strides to protect its environment. Otherwise, Malawi will most likely continue in its downward spiral.

2. Description

Figure 1. Map of Malawi

The future of Malawi's forests are in jeopardy. The diminishing forests in this small African nation will not be able to withstand current pressure from the tobacco industry and population growth for much longer. If forest loss continues, there will be many negative environmental and social costs. The productive capacity of the land, in addition to the well being of the people, depends on the protection of Malawi's forests. It is ironic that tobacco, a crop that was once seen as Malawi's key for development, may in fact lead this African nation to its demise.

This case study will look at many of the economic and political conditions which have lead this nation to its dependence on tobacco. It will further explore some of the economic, environmental and development implications tobacco production has had on Malawi. Malawi's vulnerability as a tobacco exporter, both environmentally and economically, will also be discussed. And of course, the link between tobacco production and deforestation will be examined in this case study.

Malawi, often referred to as 'The Warm Heart of Africa,' lies in the Eastern portion of Central Africa along the Great Rift Valley. Unfortunately, this nation, home to nearly 10 million people, has failed to secure its position on the path toward development and faces a very uncertain future. Malawi is confronted with many problems. It is considered one of the world's poorest nations, its economy remains weak, its external debt is 2.3 billion, AIDS is ravaging the population, and the average life expectancy is a mere 36.6 years. As if this were not enough, Malawi's environment, the backbone of the economy and the social structure, is also in danger. Deforestation is considered the biggest environmental problem facing Malawi (CIA web page). One of the causes of deforestation in Malawi is the production of tobacco leafs for export.

Figure 2. View from Zomba Plateau, Malawi

Malawi's economy is heavily entrenched in the agriculture sector - especially tobacco. Tobacco alone accounts for nearly 80% of Malawi's export earnings (Hobbs, 1998). Other agriculture products, namely tea and sugar, constitute nearly 20% of the nation's exports. This issue of exports is critical to a country in need of foreign currency to pay its external debt. Malawi's international debt was was $2.27 billion in 1997 and is expected to rise to $2.42 by the end of 1999 (Corssboars Monitor, 1997).

Forty-five percent of the country's GDP comes from agriculture. This figure would be considerably higher if it included the extensive subsistence agricultural production in Malawi. Roughly 90 percent of the population lives in rural areas, most of whom are involved in subsistence agriculture. The tobacco industry dominates the agricultural sector and is the nation's second largest employer after the government. Tea and sugar are also important crops for Malawi.

Tobacco and Deforestation

Figure 3. Tobacco bales

The correlation between tobacco and deforestation has received little attention to date. This is largely because few countries produce enough tobacco for the environmental ramifications to pose a significant threat. For all countries which export tobacco - except for two - one of which is Malawi (the other is Zimbabwe), export earnings for tobacco constitute less than 2.2% of their foreign exchange earnings. As noted earlier, tobacco constitutes nearly 80% of Malawi's export earnings. While some countries may be able to ignore the potential threat of the tobacco industry on deforestation, Malawi can not. Over 4% of Malawi's land is dedicated to producing tobacco, a much larger percentage than other tobacco producing nations (Panos, 1999). For Malawi, a small nation with limited natural resources, the forests represent one of the few assets the nation has.

The primary way in which tobacco contributes to deforestation is through the curing of the tobacco leaf, a process that requires the burning of fuel wood. It is difficult to assess exactly how much wood is need for curing tobacco, but some argue that it takes as much as three hectares of trees to cure one hectare of tobacco in some countries (Madeley, 1993). In Malawi, it has been estimated that tobacco growers account for as much as 25% of household wood consumption (Tobin, 1998). By the early 1990s, the Malawi government acknowledged that it had one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world (Tobin, 1998). However, the government has not identified tobacco as a primary cause of deforestation. Tobacco production can also aggravate deforestation through the need for wood to construct curing huts, structures that need to be replaced every one to two years. And of course the need to clear land for cultivation also contributes to forest degradation.

Yet, there is no consensus regarding the impact of the tobacco industry on deforestation on Malawi. Some assert that tobacco production in Malawi has a direct negative impact on the forest resources in this African country (Madeley,1993). In contrast, there are those who argue that there is no basis for such claims. It is worth noting that those who fall into this later category are the ones who stand to gain the most from continued tobacco production in Malawi. In fact, the Tobacco Association of Malawi states not only that tobacco production poses no threat to forest resources, but they further state that their reforestation programs are actually resulting in a net increase on forest resources. 

Bed rest is well known to have numerous adverse effects on the human body (see Table 1).1, 2 Functional decline, defined as loss of the ability to perform self-care or activities of daily living, may result not only from illness or adverse treatment effects, but also from deconditioning associated with inactivity, the negative effects of which can be seen after relatively short periods. For a variety of reasons, however, hospitalized patients spend most of their time in bed, even when they are able to walk. For example, a study of 45 elderly patients on a general medical unit, who had neither delirium nor dementia and were able to walk prior to admission, found that they spent an average of 20 out of every 24 hours in bed over the mean 5.1 days they were hospitalized.3 Similarly, researchers who studied 78 adults admitted to a respiratory unit for diagnostic or preoperative evaluation, who were able to walk and not confined to bed rest, found that over a five-day period their functional capacity had decreased in all six areas assessed: upper limb muscle strength, respiratory muscle strength, lung function, chest wall expansion, submaximal exercise tolerance, and spinal and trunk mobility, the latter of which was associated with a 30% rise in reports of back pain.4 Longer periods of hospitalization inevitably lead to more severe deconditioning.

It is a reasonable conjecture that the general principles of settlement which they at first suggested originated with the more liberal statesmen of Germany and Austria, the men who have begun to feel the force of their own peoples' thought and purpose, while the concrete terms of actual settlement came from the military leaders who have no thought but to keep what they have got. The negotiations have been broken off. The Russian representatives were sincere and in earnest. They cannot entertain such proposals of conquest and domination. MASK BOY: Well, that’s a start.

CHER: Well, what about your news?

MASK BOY: Oh, it’s no big deal. I met a girl. We’re going out.

CHER: Come on. Tell us.

MASK BOY: Well, her name is Diana ….

CHER: Yeah?

MASK BOY: And she’s beautiful. She’s got long blond hair. (A friend whistles.) She rides horses and she’s beautiful and she’s smart and she loves me.

CHER: What’s not to love, baby?

SCENE 14 (OLD MAN enters his kitchen. Sitting at the table, he looks through a photo album filled with pictures of himself and his son, the Great Mutato as a child.. POLLIDORI enters, angry.)

POLLIDORI: Tell me it isn’t true. You didn’t. You wouldn’t. Why?

OLD MAN: Because I can.

(POLLIDORI attacks OLD MAN)

(Grunting as we see the shadows of the two men struggling, POLLIDORI strangling the OLD MAN.)

(Commercial.)

SCENE 15 (J.J.’S diner. MULDER enters. Everyone is hostile. MULDER defensive and over it. Exact opposite of earlier scene. LARGE MAN sticks his leg out as if to trip MULDER.)

LARGE MAN: (sarcastically) Excuse me.

MULDER: (also sarcastic) Not a problem.

(Another hostile diner flips a spoonful of grits? at MULDER which lands on the back of his neck. MULDER reacts with disgust. He sits down and wipes the offending matter away. In the kitchen, J.J. spits loudly onto a plate of barely cooked eggs and hands it to the WAITRESS. The WAITRESS puts it down in front of MULDER.)

MULDER: (looking at disgusting eggs) What’s this?

WAITRESS: (saccharine) Compliments of J.J. Coffee?

MULDER: (looking away) Sure.

(WAITRESS spills hot coffee in MULDER’S lap. He jumps up, brushing off his crotch.)

MULDER: Whoa! That’s not a place you want to burn a guy.

(WAITRESS flounces away. MULDER looks as newspaper headline : "FBI Agents Say Monster A ‘Hoax’.")

(Commotion outside. Lots of people running past the diner. MULDER follows them to where there is a large gathering outside the post office.)

POSTAL MAN: You want to see your monster? Replicating nanorobots

MNT nanofacturing is popularly linked with the idea of swarms of coordinated nanoscale robots working together, a popularization of an early proposal by K. Eric Drexler in his 1986 discussions of MNT, but superseded in 1992. In this early proposal, sufficiently capable nanorobots would construct more nanorobots in an artificial environment containing special molecular building blocks.

Critics have doubted both the feasibility of self-replicating nanorobots and the feasibility of control if self-replicating nanorobots could be achieved: they cite the possibility of mutations removing any control and favoring reproduction of mutant pathogenic variations. Advocates address the first doubt by pointing out that the first macroscale autonomous machine replicator, made of Lego blocks, was built and operated experimentally in 2002.[8] While there are sensory advantages present at the macroscale compared to the limited sensorium available at the nanoscale, proposals for positionally controlled nanoscale mechanosynthetic fabrication systems employ dead reckoning of tooltips combined with reliable reaction sequence design to ensure reliable results, hence a limited sensorium is no handicap; similar considerations apply to the positional assembly of small nanoparts. Advocates address the second doubt by arguing that bacteria are (of necessity) evolved to evolve, while nanorobot mutation could be actively prevented by common error-correcting techniques. Similar ideas are advocated in the Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology,[9] and a map of the 137-dimensional replicator design space[10] recently published by Freitas and Merkle provides numerous proposed methods by which replicators could, in principle, be safely controlled by good design.

However, the concept of suppressing mutation raises the question: How can design evolution occur at the nanoscale without a process of random mutation and deterministic selection? Critics argue that MNT advocates have not provided a substitute for such a process of evolution in this nanoscale arena where conventional sensory-based selection processes are lacking. The limits of the sensorium available at the nanoscale could make it difficult or impossible to winnow successes from failures. Advocates argue that design evolution should occur deterministically and strictly under human control, using the conventional engineering paradigm of modeling, design, prototyping, testing, analysis, and redesign.
