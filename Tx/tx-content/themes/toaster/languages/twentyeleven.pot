We hope you enjoy exploring our website, and please don’t hesitate to contact us with any questions along the way.“The poem,” said Henri Meschonnic, “is the place where one forgets, which is another way of remembering”; so recurrence in COTP: the engram, “memories” of earlier lines (from italics to roman or back again: not so much the chant of memory as the return of same as difference: lines that reappear but are changed now), the sounds of My Life here but with all nostalgic notes bracketed by some kind of chic chilliness, really I am sorry for being so flat here but… COTP teaches; as we encounter it (a declaration about time, in time) later, too: “memory and the present are not in opposition” (43) so I’m trying to respond to her book with a language that admits its caught but wants that admission to grant a bit of fleetness, too.

-Or “When the anarchic excess has already been anticipated, what next?” (9)—is that not the most trustable place to start? What I mean is, I admire to the roots the way LR has always struggled to find the better (?)/the improved and more human irony: “Also you have aspired to a sincerity of skepticism”; so the poem talks to itself (the poet thinks with her poem / talks to her poem) straight out from the first “conditional” problem—but what I like is how LR isn’t ever mired in the problem of what to say or how to proceed… the only crisis—again, I think COTP teaches this—is failing to recognize that this is the constant condition: one must keep aspiring, aspirating, remembering that one has forgotten to remember, again and again again… Later we get: “the form never extinguishes its own irony” (49) until the poem pushes beautifully against its own desire for both sincerity and slickness.

-This is the thing for an I like me: “an unknowing expands within your pronoun but it feels convivial” (12); I like this party being thrown for two pronouns that can’t really meet and therefore that’s their intimate rendezvous—like LR is saying (to herself, to a future I, to an us) just deal… and offering another definition of the poet or the lover in action: an unknowing that grows within a coherence in order to warmly disrupt that wholeness. And/or this: “you carried the great discovery of poetry as freedom, not form” (75).

-Or instead try this these love is “your muscles made into extremely fine and silky tools” or love is “what light did, how the trees freed it” or love is “an inversion in perception” or love is “the smell of rain, bread and exhaust mixed with tiredness.”

-“And if you yourself are incompatible with your view of the world?” (13); one thinks, I think, towards this ever-answer/question: hence the poem? That is, what poet would not benefit immeasurably from a poetics of just this kind of thisness: insist in your poems on being incompatible with your view of the world (i.e. LR’s kinda sorta How to Write).Position a rack about 6 inches from the broiler and heat the broiler to high.

Heat the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the pepper and continue cooking until the pepper is soft and the onion is lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add the apple, mustard, sour cream, and parsley. Remove from the heat, cover, and keep warm.

Arrange the bratwurst on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and broil, turning once, until browned and fully cooked, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Remove the foil from the baking sheet.

Put the rolls on the baking sheet cut side up and broil until lightly toasted. Set aside the tops of the rolls, sprinkle the bottoms with the cheese, and broil until the cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes. Top with the bratwurst, the relish, and the tops of the rolls.Sun Nov  9 21:14:40 PST 2014
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (/'g?rt?/;[1] German: ['jo?han 'v?lfga? f?n 'gø?t?] ( listen); 28 August 1749 – 22 March 1832) was a German writer and statesman. His body of work includes epic and lyric poetry written in a variety of metres and styles; prose and verse dramas; memoirs; an autobiography; literary and aesthetic criticism; treatises on botany, anatomy, and colour; and four novels. In addition, numerous literary and scientific fragments, more than 10,000 letters, and nearly 3,000 drawings by him are extant.

A literary celebrity by the age of 25, Goethe was ennobled by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Carl August in 1782 after first taking up residence there in November 1775 following the success of his first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther. He was an early participant in the Sturm und Drang literary movement. During his first ten years in Weimar, Goethe served as a member of the Duke's privy council, sat on the war and highway commissions, oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby Ilmenau, and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the University of Jena. He also contributed to the planning of Weimar's botanical park and the rebuilding of its Ducal Palace, which in 1998 were together designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[2]

After returning from a tour of Italy in 1788, his first major scientific work, the Metamorphosis of Plants, was published. In 1791 he was made managing director of the theatre at Weimar, and in 1794 he began a friendship with the dramatist, historian, and philosopher Friedrich Schiller, whose plays he premiered until Schiller's death in 1805. During this period Goethe published his second novel, Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, the verse epic Hermann and Dorothea, and, in 1808, the first part of his most celebrated drama, Faust. His conversations and various common undertakings throughout the 1790s with Schiller, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Johann Gottfried Herder, Alexander von Humboldt, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and August and Friedrich Schlegel have, in later years, been collectively termed Weimar Classicism.

Arthur Schopenhauer cited Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship as one of the four greatest novels ever written[citation needed] and Ralph Waldo Emerson selected Goethe as one of six "representative men" in his work of the same name, along with Plato, Napoleon, and William Shakespeare. Goethe's comments and observations form the basis of several biographical works, most notably Johann Peter Eckermann's Conversations with Goethe. There are frequent references to Goethe's writings throughout the works of G. W. F. Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann, Sigmund Freud, and Carl Jung. Goethe's poems were set to music throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by a number of composers, including Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Charles Gounod, Richard Wagner, Hugo Wolf, and Gustav Mahler.(GOSS NET 1) Tape 1/3 Page 3

1. The Issue
Tobacco is well known for its negative effects on health. Yet, the environmental impact of tobacco production is not always recognized. There appears to be a direct link between tobacco production and deforestation. For countries that devote much of their land to the production of tobacco, this could pose a problem. Malawi is one such example. Tobacco is Malawi's largest industry and currently accounts for nearly 80% of the nation's export earnings. Strong government support for the tobacco industry, including subsidies and tax breaks, has led to tobacco's domination of Malawi's export market. The tobacco industry was intended to increase economic growth and promote development in Malawi. Unfortunately, things have not gone accordingly to plan. The price of tobacco on international markets continues to fall, with no sign of abating. Malawi remains economically stunted, the average live expectancy is gradually declining, and malnutrition, especially in children, continues to be a serious problem. Further, the environmental resources of this nation are at risk. Deforestation, in particular, is a major problem in Malawi. The threat of deforestation, some argue (Tobin, 1998), can be largely attributed to the tobacco industry. Malawi is now at a pivotal point where it must reevaluate its economic strategy and make strides to protect its environment. Otherwise, Malawi will most likely continue in its downward spiral.

2. Description

Figure 1. Map of Malawi

The future of Malawi's forests are in jeopardy. The diminishing forests in this small African nation will not be able to withstand current pressure from the tobacco industry and population growth for much longer. If forest loss continues, there will be many negative environmental and social costs. The productive capacity of the land, in addition to the well being of the people, depends on the protection of Malawi's forests. It is ironic that tobacco, a crop that was once seen as Malawi's key for development, may in fact lead this African nation to its demise.

This case study will look at many of the economic and political conditions which have lead this nation to its dependence on tobacco. It will further explore some of the economic, environmental and development implications tobacco production has had on Malawi. Malawi's vulnerability as a tobacco exporter, both environmentally and economically, will also be discussed. And of course, the link between tobacco production and deforestation will be examined in this case study.

Malawi, often referred to as 'The Warm Heart of Africa,' lies in the Eastern portion of Central Africa along the Great Rift Valley. Unfortunately, this nation, home to nearly 10 million people, has failed to secure its position on the path toward development and faces a very uncertain future. Malawi is confronted with many problems. It is considered one of the world's poorest nations, its economy remains weak, its external debt is 2.3 billion, AIDS is ravaging the population, and the average life expectancy is a mere 36.6 years. As if this were not enough, Malawi's environment, the backbone of the economy and the social structure, is also in danger. Deforestation is considered the biggest environmental problem facing Malawi (CIA web page). One of the causes of deforestation in Malawi is the production of tobacco leafs for export.

Figure 2. View from Zomba Plateau, Malawi

Malawi's economy is heavily entrenched in the agriculture sector - especially tobacco. Tobacco alone accounts for nearly 80% of Malawi's export earnings (Hobbs, 1998). Other agriculture products, namely tea and sugar, constitute nearly 20% of the nation's exports. This issue of exports is critical to a country in need of foreign currency to pay its external debt. Malawi's international debt was was $2.27 billion in 1997 and is expected to rise to $2.42 by the end of 1999 (Corssboars Monitor, 1997).

Forty-five percent of the country's GDP comes from agriculture. This figure would be considerably higher if it included the extensive subsistence agricultural production in Malawi. Roughly 90 percent of the population lives in rural areas, most of whom are involved in subsistence agriculture. The tobacco industry dominates the agricultural sector and is the nation's second largest employer after the government. Tea and sugar are also important crops for Malawi.

Tobacco and Deforestation

Figure 3. Tobacco bales

The correlation between tobacco and deforestation has received little attention to date. This is largely because few countries produce enough tobacco for the environmental ramifications to pose a significant threat. For all countries which export tobacco - except for two - one of which is Malawi (the other is Zimbabwe), export earnings for tobacco constitute less than 2.2% of their foreign exchange earnings. As noted earlier, tobacco constitutes nearly 80% of Malawi's export earnings. While some countries may be able to ignore the potential threat of the tobacco industry on deforestation, Malawi can not. Over 4% of Malawi's land is dedicated to producing tobacco, a much larger percentage than other tobacco producing nations (Panos, 1999). For Malawi, a small nation with limited natural resources, the forests represent one of the few assets the nation has.

The primary way in which tobacco contributes to deforestation is through the curing of the tobacco leaf, a process that requires the burning of fuel wood. It is difficult to assess exactly how much wood is need for curing tobacco, but some argue that it takes as much as three hectares of trees to cure one hectare of tobacco in some countries (Madeley, 1993). In Malawi, it has been estimated that tobacco growers account for as much as 25% of household wood consumption (Tobin, 1998). By the early 1990s, the Malawi government acknowledged that it had one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world (Tobin, 1998). However, the government has not identified tobacco as a primary cause of deforestation. Tobacco production can also aggravate deforestation through the need for wood to construct curing huts, structures that need to be replaced every one to two years. And of course the need to clear land for cultivation also contributes to forest degradation.

Yet, there is no consensus regarding the impact of the tobacco industry on deforestation on Malawi. Some assert that tobacco production in Malawi has a direct negative impact on the forest resources in this African country (Madeley,1993). In contrast, there are those who argue that there is no basis for such claims. It is worth noting that those who fall into this later category are the ones who stand to gain the most from continued tobacco production in Malawi. In fact, the Tobacco Association of Malawi states not only that tobacco production poses no threat to forest resources, but they further state that their reforestation programs are actually resulting in a net increase on forest resources.

In fact, the Tobacco Association of Malawi states not only that tobacco production poses no threat to forest resources, but they further state that their reforestation programs are actually resulting in a net increase on forest resources. The book deals ostensibly with the March on the Pentagon (the October 1967 anti-Vietnam War rally in Washington, D.C.) While Mailer dips into familiar territory, his fiction—self-portrait—the outlandish, third person account of himself along with self-descriptions such as a novelist/historian, anti-star/hero are made far more complex by the narrative's overall generic identification as a nonfiction novel. Two years before Armies was published, In Cold Blood by Truman Capote, who had just been called by George Plimpton (among others) the "inventor" of the nonfiction novel, claimed that the genre should exclude any mention of its subjectivity and refrain from the first person. While to some extent satirizing Capote's model, Mailer's role in center stage is hardly self-glamorizing, as the narrative recounts the events leading up to the March as well as his subsequent arrest and night in jail. The first section, "History as a Novel", begins: "From the outset, let us bring you news of your protagonist", with an account made by TIME about: "Washington's scruffy Ambassador Theater, normally a pad for psychedelic frolics, was the scene of an unscheduled scatological solo last week in support of the peace demonstrations. Its anti-star was author Norman Mailer, who proved even less prepared to explain Why Are We In Vietnam? than his current novel bearing that title." After citing the entire article, Mailer then closes, "1: Pen Pals" with "Now we may leave Time in order to find out what happened." What creates the difference between Mailer's example and Capote's is not only the autobiography of Armies, but the irony which guides the narrator towards the same objective of empiricism as that of In Cold Blood. The non-conformity which Mailer exhibits to Capote's criterion was the beginning of a feud that never resolved between the authors, and was ended with Capote's death in 1984.[citation needed]

The year Armies was published, 1968, Mailer would begin work on another project, Miami and the Siege of Chicago, after witnessing the Republican and Democratic National Conventions that year. Mailer's recounting, though quite different in terms of his self-portrait, takes on a comparable rhetorical approach to evoking what he saw as historical underpinnings.

The three then travel to Rebma, a reflection of Amber underwater, and there they meet their sister Llewella and Moire, the queen of Rebma. Moire originally believes that the three of them came to Rebma to seek support to defeat Eric but Deirdre explains their true intentions. Because Rebma is a reflection of Amber, there is also a reflection of the Pattern in Rebma, which Corwin is to walk to restore his memory. Although Random is impounded for past crimes in Rebma and sentenced to wed a blind girl named Vialle, Corwin convinces the queen Moire to allow him to walk the Pattern. After receiving advice from Random and Deirdre, he walks the Pattern, reliving all of his past life, which stretches back to his time in Amber and when Eric deposited him in Elizabethan England on our Earth. He remembers the powers which his heritage and the Pattern grant him - the power to walk through shadow, and to pronounce a powerful curse before dying. After he completes the Pattern he uses its power to project himself into the Castle of Amber, from which he finds a safe spot and rests.Position a rack about 6 inches from the broiler and heat the broiler to high.

Heat the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the pepper and continue cooking until the pepper is soft and the onion is lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add the apple, mustard, sour cream, and parsley. Remove from the heat, cover, and keep warm.

Arrange the bratwurst on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and broil, turning once, until browned and fully cooked, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Remove the foil from the baking sheet.

Put the rolls on the baking sheet cut side up and broil until lightly toasted. Set aside the tops of the rolls, sprinkle the bottoms with the cheese, and broil until the cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes. Top with the bratwurst, the relish, and the tops of the rolls.“The poem,” said Henri Meschonnic, “is the place where one forgets, which is another way of remembering”; so recurrence in COTP: the engram, “memories” of earlier lines (from italics to roman or back again: not so much the chant of memory as the return of same as difference: lines that reappear but are changed now), the sounds of My Life here but with all nostalgic notes bracketed by some kind of chic chilliness, really I am sorry for being so flat here but… COTP teaches; as we encounter it (a declaration about time, in time) later, too: “memory and the present are not in opposition” (43) so I’m trying to respond to her book with a language that admits its caught but wants that admission to grant a bit of fleetness, too.

-Or “When the anarchic excess has already been anticipated, what next?” (9)—is that not the most trustable place to start? What I mean is, I admire to the roots the way LR has always struggled to find the better (?)/the improved and more human irony: “Also you have aspired to a sincerity of skepticism”; so the poem talks to itself (the poet thinks with her poem / talks to her poem) straight out from the first “conditional” problem—but what I like is how LR isn’t ever mired in the problem of what to say or how to proceed… the only crisis—again, I think COTP teaches this—is failing to recognize that this is the constant condition: one must keep aspiring, aspirating, remembering that one has forgotten to remember, again and again again… Later we get: “the form never extinguishes its own irony” (49) until the poem pushes beautifully against its own desire for both sincerity and slickness.

-This is the thing for an I like me: “an unknowing expands within your pronoun but it feels convivial” (12); I like this party being thrown for two pronouns that can’t really meet and therefore that’s their intimate rendezvous—like LR is saying (to herself, to a future I, to an us) just deal… and offering another definition of the poet or the lover in action: an unknowing that grows within a coherence in order to warmly disrupt that wholeness. And/or this: “you carried the great discovery of poetry as freedom, not form” (75).

-Or instead try this these love is “your muscles made into extremely fine and silky tools” or love is “what light did, how the trees freed it” or love is “an inversion in perception” or love is “the smell of rain, bread and exhaust mixed with tiredness.”

-“And if you yourself are incompatible with your view of the world?” (13); one thinks, I think, towards this ever-answer/question: hence the poem? That is, what poet would not benefit immeasurably from a poetics of just this kind of thisness: insist in your poems on being incompatible with your view of the world (i.e. LR’s kinda sorta How to Write).

The human characteristics of curiosity, wonder, and ingenuity are as old as mankind. People around the world have been harnessing their curiosity into inquiry and the process of scientific methodology
Recent years have witnessed an unprecedented growth in research in the area of nanoscience. There is increasing optimism that nanotechnology applied to medicine and dentistry will bring significant advances in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. Growing interest in the future medical applications of nanotechnology is leading to the emergence of a new field called nanomedicine. Nanomedicine needs to overcome the challenges for its application, to improve the understanding of pathophysiologic basis of disease, bring more sophisticated diagnostic opportunities, and yield more effective therapies and preventive properties. When doctors gain access to medical robots, they will be able to quickly cure most known diseases that hobble and kill people today, to rapidly repair most physical injuries our bodies can suffer, and to vastly extend the human health span. Molecular technology is destined to become the core technology underlying all of 21st century medicine and dentistry. In this article, we have made an attempt to have an early glimpse on future impact of nanotechnology in medicine and dentistry.

I am not reciting these facts for the purpose of recrimination. That I judge to be utterly futile and even harmful. We cannot afford it. I recite them in order to explain why it was we did not have, as we could have had, between twelve and fourteen British divisions fighting in the line in this great battle instead of only three. Now I put all this aside. I put it on the shelf, from which the historians, when they have time, will select their documents to tell their stories. We have to think of the future and not of the past. This also applies in a small way to our own affairs at home. There are many who would hold an inquest in the House of Commons on the conduct of the Governments--and of Parliaments, for they are in it, too--during the years which led up to this catastrophe. They seek to indict those who were responsible for the guidance of our affairs. This also would be a foolish and pernicious process. There are too many in it. Let each man search his conscience and search his speeches. I frequently search mine.
