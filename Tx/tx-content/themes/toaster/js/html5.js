“The poem,” said Henri Meschonnic, “is the place where one forgets, which is another way of remembering”; so recurrence in COTP: the engram, “memories” of earlier lines (from italics to roman or back again: not so much the chant of memory as the return of same as difference: lines that reappear but are changed now), the sounds of My Life here but with all nostalgic notes bracketed by some kind of chic chilliness, really I am sorry for being so flat here but… COTP teaches; as we encounter it (a declaration about time, in time) later, too: “memory and the present are not in opposition” (43) so I’m trying to respond to her book with a language that admits its caught but wants that admission to grant a bit of fleetness, too.

-Or “When the anarchic excess has already been anticipated, what next?” (9)—is that not the most trustable place to start? What I mean is, I admire to the roots the way LR has always struggled to find the better (?)/the improved and more human irony: “Also you have aspired to a sincerity of skepticism”; so the poem talks to itself (the poet thinks with her poem / talks to her poem) straight out from the first “conditional” problem—but what I like is how LR isn’t ever mired in the problem of what to say or how to proceed… the only crisis—again, I think COTP teaches this—is failing to recognize that this is the constant condition: one must keep aspiring, aspirating, remembering that one has forgotten to remember, again and again again… Later we get: “the form never extinguishes its own irony” (49) until the poem pushes beautifully against its own desire for both sincerity and slickness.

-This is the thing for an I like me: “an unknowing expands within your pronoun but it feels convivial” (12); I like this party being thrown for two pronouns that can’t really meet and therefore that’s their intimate rendezvous—like LR is saying (to herself, to a future I, to an us) just deal… and offering another definition of the poet or the lover in action: an unknowing that grows within a coherence in order to warmly disrupt that wholeness. And/or this: “you carried the great discovery of poetry as freedom, not form” (75).

-Or instead try this these love is “your muscles made into extremely fine and silky tools” or love is “what light did, how the trees freed it” or love is “an inversion in perception” or love is “the smell of rain, bread and exhaust mixed with tiredness.”

-“And if you yourself are incompatible with your view of the world?” (13); one thinks, I think, towards this ever-answer/question: hence the poem? That is, what poet would not benefit immeasurably from a poetics of just this kind of thisness: insist in your poems on being incompatible with your view of the world (i.e. LR’s kinda sorta How to Write).About the Project

This project is an online interactive featuring the Eagle lunar landing. The presentation includes original Apollo 11 spaceflight video footage, communication audio, mission control room conversations, text transcripts, and telemetry data, all synchronized into an integrated audio-visual experience.

Until today, it has been impossible to comprehensively experience mankind's shining exploratory accomplishment in a singular experience. We have compiled hours of content available from public domain sources and various NASA websites. Thamtech staff and volunteers generously devoted their time to transcribe hours of speech to text. By using simultaneous space and land based audio and video, transcripts, images, spacecraft telemetry, and biomedical data—this synchronized presentation reveals the Moon Shot as experienced by the astronauts and flight controllers.

Our goal is to capture a moment in history so that generations may now relive the events with this interactive educational resource. The world remembers the moon landing as a major historical event but often fails to recognize the scale of the mission. This interactive resource aims to educate visitors while engaging them with the excitement of manned-spaceflight to build a passion for scientific exploration.

Visitors begin the experience by hearing the words of Buzz Aldrin while simultaneously viewing the moon through the lunar module window. Moments later, the audience hears capsule communicator Charlie Duke inform flight director Gene Kranz that the astronauts are on schedule to start the descent engine. Throughout the presentation, visitors are able to customize their experience by jumping to key moments in the timeline. The timeline guides visitors to the crucial moments in the mission, including: program alarms (computer alerts), famous Go No-Go polls in the control room, low level fuel milestones, and landing.

"The Eagle has Landed." Neil Armstrong's words signal a technical milestone and successful execution of John F. Kennedy's vision to land a man on the moon safely. Prior to these famous words, visitors see the synchronized audio communications, transcripts, video of the lunar module's casting a shadow on the lunar surface, and biomedical telemetry of Armstrong's heart rate surpassing 150 beats per minute!

The footprints from Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969 paved the way for five additional successful trips to the lunar surface over the following years. Thamtech takes pride in providing visitors with a glimpse into this and mankind's enduring spirit for exploration.

Heat the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the pepper and continue cooking until the pepper is soft and the onion is lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add the apple, mustard, sour cream, and parsley. Remove from the heat, cover, and keep warm.

Arrange the bratwurst on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and broil, turning once, until browned and fully cooked, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Remove the foil from the baking sheet.

Put the rolls on the baking sheet cut side up and broil until lightly toasted. Set aside the tops of the rolls, sprinkle the bottoms with the cheese, and broil until the cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes. Top with the bratwurst, the relish, and the tops of the rolls. I. Identification

1. The Issue
Tobacco is well known for its negative effects on health. Yet, the environmental impact of tobacco production is not always recognized. There appears to be a direct link between tobacco production and deforestation. For countries that devote much of their land to the production of tobacco, this could pose a problem. Malawi is one such example. Tobacco is Malawi's largest industry and currently accounts for nearly 80% of the nation's export earnings. Strong government support for the tobacco industry, including subsidies and tax breaks, has led to tobacco's domination of Malawi's export market. The tobacco industry was intended to increase economic growth and promote development in Malawi. Unfortunately, things have not gone accordingly to plan. The price of tobacco on international markets continues to fall, with no sign of abating. Malawi remains economically stunted, the average live expectancy is gradually declining, and malnutrition, especially in children, continues to be a serious problem. Further, the environmental resources of this nation are at risk. Deforestation, in particular, is a major problem in Malawi. The threat of deforestation, some argue (Tobin, 1998), can be largely attributed to the tobacco industry. Malawi is now at a pivotal point where it must reevaluate its economic strategy and make strides to protect its environment. Otherwise, Malawi will most likely continue in its downward spiral.

2. Description

Figure 1. Map of Malawi

The future of Malawi's forests are in jeopardy. The diminishing forests in this small African nation will not be able to withstand current pressure from the tobacco industry and population growth for much longer. If forest loss continues, there will be many negative environmental and social costs. The productive capacity of the land, in addition to the well being of the people, depends on the protection of Malawi's forests. It is ironic that tobacco, a crop that was once seen as Malawi's key for development, may in fact lead this African nation to its demise.

This case study will look at many of the economic and political conditions which have lead this nation to its dependence on tobacco. It will further explore some of the economic, environmental and development implications tobacco production has had on Malawi. Malawi's vulnerability as a tobacco exporter, both environmentally and economically, will also be discussed. And of course, the link between tobacco production and deforestation will be examined in this case study.

Malawi, often referred to as 'The Warm Heart of Africa,' lies in the Eastern portion of Central Africa along the Great Rift Valley. Unfortunately, this nation, home to nearly 10 million people, has failed to secure its position on the path toward development and faces a very uncertain future. Malawi is confronted with many problems. It is considered one of the world's poorest nations, its economy remains weak, its external debt is 2.3 billion, AIDS is ravaging the population, and the average life expectancy is a mere 36.6 years. As if this were not enough, Malawi's environment, the backbone of the economy and the social structure, is also in danger. Deforestation is considered the biggest environmental problem facing Malawi (CIA web page). One of the causes of deforestation in Malawi is the production of tobacco leafs for export.

Figure 2. View from Zomba Plateau, Malawi

Malawi's economy is heavily entrenched in the agriculture sector - especially tobacco. Tobacco alone accounts for nearly 80% of Malawi's export earnings (Hobbs, 1998). Other agriculture products, namely tea and sugar, constitute nearly 20% of the nation's exports. This issue of exports is critical to a country in need of foreign currency to pay its external debt. Malawi's international debt was was $2.27 billion in 1997 and is expected to rise to $2.42 by the end of 1999 (Corssboars Monitor, 1997).

Forty-five percent of the country's GDP comes from agriculture. This figure would be considerably higher if it included the extensive subsistence agricultural production in Malawi. Roughly 90 percent of the population lives in rural areas, most of whom are involved in subsistence agriculture. The tobacco industry dominates the agricultural sector and is the nation's second largest employer after the government. Tea and sugar are also important crops for Malawi.

Tobacco and Deforestation

Figure 3. Tobacco bales

The correlation between tobacco and deforestation has received little attention to date. This is largely because few countries produce enough tobacco for the environmental ramifications to pose a significant threat. For all countries which export tobacco - except for two - one of which is Malawi (the other is Zimbabwe), export earnings for tobacco constitute less than 2.2% of their foreign exchange earnings. As noted earlier, tobacco constitutes nearly 80% of Malawi's export earnings. While some countries may be able to ignore the potential threat of the tobacco industry on deforestation, Malawi can not. Over 4% of Malawi's land is dedicated to producing tobacco, a much larger percentage than other tobacco producing nations (Panos, 1999). For Malawi, a small nation with limited natural resources, the forests represent one of the few assets the nation has.

The primary way in which tobacco contributes to deforestation is through the curing of the tobacco leaf, a process that requires the burning of fuel wood. It is difficult to assess exactly how much wood is need for curing tobacco, but some argue that it takes as much as three hectares of trees to cure one hectare of tobacco in some countries (Madeley, 1993). In Malawi, it has been estimated that tobacco growers account for as much as 25% of household wood consumption (Tobin, 1998). By the early 1990s, the Malawi government acknowledged that it had one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world (Tobin, 1998). However, the government has not identified tobacco as a primary cause of deforestation. Tobacco production can also aggravate deforestation through the need for wood to construct curing huts, structures that need to be replaced every one to two years. And of course the need to clear land for cultivation also contributes to forest degradation.

Yet, there is no consensus regarding the impact of the tobacco industry on deforestation on Malawi. Some assert that tobacco production in Malawi has a direct negative impact on the forest resources in this African country (Madeley,1993). In contrast, there are those who argue that there is no basis for such claims. It is worth noting that those who fall into this later category are the ones who stand to gain the most from continued tobacco production in Malawi. In fact, the Tobacco Association of Malawi states not only that tobacco production poses no threat to forest resources, but they further state that their reforestation programs are actually resulting in a net increase on forest resources.

The three then travel to Rebma, a reflection of Amber underwater, and there they meet their sister Llewella and Moire, the queen of Rebma. Moire originally believes that the three of them came to Rebma to seek support to defeat Eric but Deirdre explains their true intentions. Because Rebma is a reflection of Amber, there is also a reflection of the Pattern in Rebma, which Corwin is to walk to restore his memory. Although Random is impounded for past crimes in Rebma and sentenced to wed a blind girl named Vialle, Corwin convinces the queen Moire to allow him to walk the Pattern. After receiving advice from Random and Deirdre, he walks the Pattern, reliving all of his past life, which stretches back to his time in Amber and when Eric deposited him in Elizabethan England on our Earth. He remembers the powers which his heritage and the Pattern grant him - the power to walk through shadow, and to pronounce a powerful curse before dying. After he completes the Pattern he uses its power to project himself into the Castle of Amber, from which he finds a safe spot and rests.
