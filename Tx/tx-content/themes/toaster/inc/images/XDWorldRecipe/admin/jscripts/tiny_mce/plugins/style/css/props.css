% Marge steps in.

M: Are you kids making ugly faces?
B: Maybe.
M: Well, you know.  If you keep making those faces, you'll freeze that way.
   You'll be stuck with a horrible face forever.

% Marge leaves.

L: Do you think Mom was telling the truth?
B: Mom wouldn't lie.

% The kids consider this for a few seconds.

B+L+A: All right!

% [End of Act One.  Time: 0:30]
%
% [Act Two cut in syndication.  They continue making faces, and Marge
% returns to tell them to knock it off.  When she leaves, Bart and Lisa
% try to imitate her scowl; their attempts pale next to Maggie's
% recreation (``Look at this!'').]
%
% Same as before.

B: Watch this scary face.

% Bart makes a scary face.

L: Oh yeah?  That's not scary.

% Lisa makes a scary face.

B: Oh yeah?  That's not scary.

% Bart makes another scary face.

L: Oh yeah?  That's not...

% The door creaks open.  It's Marge, with a very scary angry face.

B+L: Waaauugh!  Scary!!

% [End of Act Three.  Time: 0:46]

L: I call this face, ``The Howler Monkey''.

% Lisa does a pretty good semblance.

B: I call this face, ``Dad''.

% Bart does a very good job.
%
% Marge bursts in.

M: All right.  I told you, if you kept making those horrible faces,
   they'd freeze that way.  And now they have.
L: They have!?
B: Our faces are frozen?
M: Yes, they are.  Go look in the mirror and see for yourselves.
